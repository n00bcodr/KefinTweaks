# KefinTweaks for Jellyfin

KefinTweaks is a comprehensive collection of enhancements and customizations for Jellyfin, focused on, but not limited to, filling gaps in functionality based on the community's most desired [Feature Requests](https://features.jellyfin.org/?view=most-wanted). While working on these scripts to meet my personal needs, I noticed that there was a lot of overlap between the functionality I desire and many of the requested features by the community so I thought it would be a good idea to share this for anyone who may be interested. There is no configuration required, but if you wish to customize some of the features, there are options to do so.
